    "# What does \"hypothesis testing\" mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is an important part of science. There are many texts about it, about p-values, about null hypotheses, and so on, which try to explain what these concepts are and avoid their misuse. Some texts are meant to be read by mathematicians, others by healthcare researchers, others by social science researchers, and they are all correct in their own way.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this text, I assume you are acquainted with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Statistics in Python (`scipy.stats`)\n",
    "* Conditional probabilities\n",
    "* The Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "I addressed the following questions:\n",

    "* What is hypothesis testing?\n",
    "* How to setup a quick hypothesis test\n",

    "## TL,DR: a quick hypothesis testing framework\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are on a rush and need to prepare a hypothesis test in the next few minutes, you could well use the following recipe:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find the *status-quo* parameter $\\theta_0$ (this is usually a mean $\\mu_0$, but theory does allow for other parameters)\n",
    "1. Estimate a new parameter $\\theta_1$, which, again, is usually an estimate of the mean $\\mu_1$ in your experimental group.\n",
    "1. Define a Null Hypothesis $H_0: \\theta_0 = \\theta_1$.\n",
    "1. Define an Alternative Hypothesis $H_1: \\theta_0 \\neq \\theta_1$ \n",
    "1. Define a significance level $\\alpha$, which is usually 5%.\n",
    "1. Calculate the p-value, which is $P(\\text{data is as extreme or more extreme as the observation} | H_0)$\n",
    "1. If the p-value is lower than $\\alpha$, reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_1$\n",
    "1. Else, you have failed to reject $H_0$ and your data cannot challenge the status-quo.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of code, this could be as simple as:\n",
    "\n",
    "`st.ttest_1samp(experimental_sample, mu0)`\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you might be asking yourself *why* do we perform each of these steps. This is far from trivial and there are many perspectives to this problem, and many ways to explain it. Keep on reading for one of the possible perspectives to the problem. "

    "Let's take for example a measurement of the weights of lettuces. According to a quick Google search, lettuces weight around 300g, but they could easily go around 250g or 350g. Because I don't know much about lettuces, I will just assume that regular lettuce weights follow a Normal distribution with $\\mu=300$ and $\\sigma=50$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's suppose I decided to grow some lettuces with a non-standard technique. This is a different population from the standard one because I purposefully intervented onto it. Now we have two groups: the *control* group, which used the standard technique, and the *experimental* group, which used the non-standard technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "We usually know things about the control group because they are well-established, but we don't know much about the experimental group because its conditions are a novelty. Hence, we will need to estimate parameters for the experimental group. How do we do this?\n"

There is obviously more to that, but in this text we are more interested in the data that comes out of this experiment than in the details of lettuce crops. We should weight some lettuces of the experimental group, which will get us the following *measurements*:\n",

    "\n",
    "We have some sample measurements in the experimental group. It's likely that these sample statistics are a bit different from the model statistics from the control group. However, because the experimental group has samples, they could hypothetically have been generated under the model parameters of the control group.\n",
    "\n",
    "That would actually be a problem, because it would mean that the experimental group and the control group follow the same statistics, and hence are not discernible. In other words, it would mean that our novel non-standard lettuce growing technique is not different from the standard one. We are especially interested in findind differences between the population means $\\mu$ and $\\mu_e$, because they represent the expected values for lettuce weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's suppose $\\mu=\\mu_e$. In this case, $\\bar{x}$ is a bit of an extreme observation, in the sense that it is a bit far from the model mean $\\mu$. This leads to our *null* hypothesis:\n",

    "The idea of a Null Hypothesis comes from a philosophical view of science that is commonly linked to Karl Popper. According to Popper, if we are to *prove* something, then we have to analyze it in all possible angles and possibilities, which is impossible. However, if we are to *disprove* something, we only need no gather any kind of evidence against it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, hypothesis testing starts with a Null Hypothesis $H_0$ which mathematically models the idea that there is nothing relevant happening in our experiment (that is: $\\mu=\\mu_e$). If we are able to gather evidence against $H_0$, then we can *reject* it. Likewise, for the reasons Popper stated, we can never *accept* the null - we can only *fail to reject* it.\n",

Consequently, there is only a probability $\\alpha$ that the p-value is lower than $\\alpha$.

    "Hence, rejecting the null hypothesis means that our observations indicate that $\\mu$ is not *strictly* equal to $\\mu_e$. It says absolutely nothing about how different they are. In fact, we would need an effect size analysis for this, which is a whole different problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting experiment is the following. If you go back to the code above and insanely increase the sample size, you will observe that $p$ quickly drops. This is one of the techniques for the so-called *p-value hacking*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although low p-values can make your boss, your funding agency, and ultimately yourself very happy, there is more to that. Effects can be statistically significant, but their practical significance should be evaluated as well. For example, we could well observe a very low p-value with a mean difference of 1g between lettuce crops, which represents less than half of a typical lettuce leaf... perhaps it is not even worth trying it in practice!\n",
