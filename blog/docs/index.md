# Welcome to my blog!

Hi, this is Tiago here! Welcome to my blog. This is where I share some thoughts and tutorials on my main driving forces: math and art. I hope you find this useful - and that I find time to write more and more!

If you feel like talking about anything, please contact me at tiagoft [at] gmail [dot] com.
